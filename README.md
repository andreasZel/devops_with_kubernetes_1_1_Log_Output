# Log output application for 1.1 Exercise of Devops with Kubernetes

This application is written in node.js, there is an image created with the
dockerfile [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zelhs/randomstring/general).

In order to run with kubernetes we first create our cluster with **k3d**:
```bash
k3d cluster create -a 2
```
then we deploy our image from the repo:
```bash
kubectl create deployment logoutput --image=zelhs/randomstring
```
we then list our pods and get it's logs:
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs logoutput-9c7974789-7h6h9 # logoutput-9c7974789-7h6h9 was my pod name
```


## For Declerative approach

Use the .yml file by executing:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifest/Deployment.yml
```

and repeating the next steps to get the logs.

## Update 1.7

Now an endpolint `http://localhost:8081/status` exist. We used an Ingress a **ClusterIP** service to forward 2345 port to 3000 and then use Ingress to pass traffic to 2345.

The port 80 should be mapped to 8081 in the cluster, so create a new one:

```bash
k3d cluster create --port 8082:30080@agent:0 -p 8081:80@loadbalancer --agents 2
```

## Update 1.9

Now a new endpoint listens to `/pingpong` by adding a new ClusterIP Service and a new Deployment

## update 1.10

Now a new endpoint listens to `localhost:8081/getString`.
